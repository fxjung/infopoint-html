Infopoint HTML Viewer
=====================

This is a XUL application that views a web page in full screen. It can be
useful for machines whose only purpose it is to show fixed information (like 
stock graphs, a network monitor, news, etc.) while the are running.


Dependencies
------------

Currently, you only need Mozilla XULRunner >= 1.9.1. Older versions may work,
but are not tested. 
You can download it from https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XULRunner#Releases


Installation
------------

There is no configure script or Makefile at the moment. You can put the 
contents of the `src/xul/` folder to any location you like, and start the
application from there, giving the URL to display on the command line:

    cp -R src/xul /usr/local/share/infopoint-html
    xulrunner /usr/local/share/infopoint-html/application.ini http://google.com
